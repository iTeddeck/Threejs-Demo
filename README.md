# Threejs-Demo
My first program in threejs for my research project under Dr. Scott Frees. Unofficially titled cube dodge.

This program is the start to my research into virtual reality with Dr. Scott Frees from Ramapo College. The goal is to develop a mini game/demo in threejs to test out its capabilities while getting comfortable and familiar with it. Ultimately I will be developing the same demo in Unity to make a side-by-side comparison. At the end, I will get together with Dr. Frees and discuss whether threejs or Unity is better to continue studying. This will all eventually lead up to me creating a game in which the player can control the main character with his/her own full body using the Oculus Rift and the tracking system we have in our lab. Incorporating other tools like the Omni-treadmill are in consideration also.
